Happy Boi is a raspberry pi proxy service

Use case: While perusing a json file obtained via the facebook internal api, i realized that the service didn't work on non-residential ips.

I built happy boi to serve traffic to one of my apps from my residential IP. Extremely dumb, but it got the job done
